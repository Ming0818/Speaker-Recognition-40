# Speaker-Recognition
a simple implementation of speaker recognition
1. fft.py is used to do get FFT of audio
2. lowpassFilter.py is the implementation of a lowpass filter
3. audioTest.py is where you can test the dataset(open SLR)
4. MFCC.py is the implementation of MFCC and you can test the dataset

**Attention**:
if you want to test the dataset on your computer,you may need to change 
the relative path of the audiofile. and you can choose witch sample to
test. It's easy to find where the code need to be changed
